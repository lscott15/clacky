Hi!
This repository has the simple firmware for an 85 key keyboard featuring a simple function layer to handle some esoteric keys (PF1-PF4), and some less often used ones (Print, etc).

The case and plate were designed in FreeCad, the firmware uses an awesome keyboard library created by wolfv6 here:
